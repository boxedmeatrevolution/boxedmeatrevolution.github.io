There is only one truth: cardboard people are on fire.</div>

Survivors of your operations pay top dollar, but one mistake and your reputation will be tarnished. &quot;Your life is my currency,&quot; you tell each one as they lie down on the table.

      <div class="game-brief">The colosseum looms large in the dry desert. Many beasts champion it: gremlins, ninjas, skeletons, robots. Adversaries of spikes! Evils of fire! What can possibly deliver the colosseum from this madness? Something slippery? You come armed. Boots of haste for rapid movement on a slick surface. Let your enemies slide to their dooms.

      <div class="game-jam-name">Ludum Dare 31: Entire game on one screen</div>
      <div class="game-brief">On its opening moment, the Spacebank&#39;s designer declared it to be unheistable because of the relativistic time effects of its close orbit around a black hole. Someone did a heist in the very next millisecond. Since then, the spacebank has been heisted over one billion times, regardless of the number of armed guards, bombs, trap mines, or missile launchers used to defend it. You are the latest heister, ready to make your space fortune, and it would be so embarassing if you were the first one to actually get caught.</div>
